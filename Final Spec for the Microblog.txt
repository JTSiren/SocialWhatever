Final Spec for the Microblog

it should allow a user to log in at /login

if a user goes to / without being logged in, redirect them to /login

redirect logged in users from /login to /

set a cookie for a logged-in user in order to keep them logged in



Create a log out button that deletes cookies.

allow a user to make posts, without reloading the page

use ajax to post! 
	this will leave the client on the browser?
	$.ajax with a post 
	
	
	There will be a homepage - when you log in, go to the homepage.
		Homepage-
			text area
			submit button


var formData = $(this).serialize();
$.post(url, formData, function(response){
	$("#signup").html("<p>Thanks for Signing Up!</p>");
	
});// end post





display to a logged in user the list of all posts made by all users

give a logged-in user the ability to log out and redirect them to the log-in page
do not allow a non-logged-in user to see posts
for each user, a logged-in user should have the ability to visit /user/NAME and see the list of all posts made by that user
a logged-in user should have the ability to delete their own posts
the main page should refresh periodically and display new posts
If you are done with those basic tasks, then some possible other additions to your website are:

adding user profiles
the user profile should be editable only by the logged-in user
the user profile should be displayed along with the list of their posts
implementing notifications and @s
add the ability to @ another user of the system
add a set of notifications for each user that displays all the messages that they’ve had @’ed at them
implementing “repost”
to each post a user should see a button to repost
when a user clicks the button then a new post is made in the format
RP> original-user: original-text
the new post is, as usual, attached to their name
make it not ugly
while you can make a prototype that uses no css or pretty formatting at all, this isn’t ideal; practice your design skills on your project
The basic structure of this project is that you will need to:

modify the file routes/index.js to provide all the routes you need
to start with, try adding them one at a time and building the views as you go
there will be some logic that you need to use within the routes, such as checking to see if a user is logged in
adding a set of views to views/, one for each page that the user will see
these views will also need to pass along javascript code for doing
event handling
cookie manipulation
ajax calls
download several helpful Javascript libraries into public/javascripts/
jQuery
js-cookie
initialize data for the application into app.js using app.locals.PROPERTY
you can access this in any route handlers using req.app.locals.PROPERTY
